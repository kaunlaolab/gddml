# omega_ggd_ML

This machine learning model enable fast prediction of the range-separation parameter $\omega_{\rm GDD}^{\rm ML}$ for the LRC-&omega;PBE functional. Given Cartesian coordinates in the form of a .xyz file, this program will generate the features used by the model and return the predicted &omega;<sup>ML<sub>GDD value.
